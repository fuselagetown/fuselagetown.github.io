<h1>Hi, I'm Torunn, <br />creative product designer and coder</h1> 
<h4>I believe the intersection of design and data is where the the magic happens to solve customer problems and drive meaningful business results.</h4>



  <p>Over the past 8 years I’ve led mission-critical product design and research projects at Stitch Fix, working with executives to define business strategy as an individual contributor.</p>
<p>
    Before that I've been designing products for a variety of start-ups e.g <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/givey">Givey</a> and led design teams at agencies. </p>
